## This Project is was my first attempt to build a whole website in pure HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript Code. 

### It is a calculation app for companies. Main features of the app:

  - 4 Page Website
  - Multistep Form to add new Project to the timeline and to Home
  - Add new employee with pop up window (coded in vanilla JavaScript)

The Design is not mine. See my [other repository for the UX/UI Design](https://github.com/gmzln/UX_UI_CalculationApp) other repository for the UX/UI Design i did. Unfortunately this one is not coded.
