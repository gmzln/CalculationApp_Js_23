## This Project is was my first attempt to build a whole website of 6 Pages in pure HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript Code. 

## It is a calculation app for companies. Main features of the app:

  - 4 Page Website
  - Multistep Form to add new Project to the timeline and to Home
  - Add new employee with pop up window (coded in vanilla JavaScript)

The Design is not mine. See my other repository for the UX/UI Design i did. Unfortunately this one is not coded. >>
